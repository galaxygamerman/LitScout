We study the energetics of wake excitation during the laser-plasma interaction in application to
laser wakefield accelerators. We find that both the wake amplitude and the accelerating efficiency
(transformer ratio) can be maximized by properly shaping the longitudinal profile of the driving laser
pulse. The corresponding family of laser pulse shapes is derived in the nonlinear regime of laser-
plasma interaction. Such shapes provide theoretical upperlimit on the magnitude of the wakefield
and efficiency by allowing for uniform photon deceleration inside the laser pulse. We also construct
realistic optimal pulse shapes that can be produced in finite-bandwidth laser systems.

Current plasma accelerators can be broadly subdivided
into two classes – the laser driven scheme [1], and the
electron beam driven scheme [2].  While the accelerat-
ing plasma waves excited in these two schemes are very
similar, the physics of wakefield excitation is quite differ-
ent between them. In the beam-driven Plasma Wakefield
Accelerator (PWFA) the electron beam loses energy to
the plasma through interaction with the induced elec-
trostatic field, while in the laser-driven Laser Wakefield
Accelerator (LWFA) energy loss occurs via photon red-
shift or deceleration [3]. This process is due to the pres-
ence of wake-induced stationary modulations in the re-
fractive index of the plasma as seen in the laser comoving
frame [4]. With the recent advances in laser technology,
the creation of ultrashort pulses with virtually arbitrary
temporal profiles is now possible by using amplitude and
phase pulse shapers [5]. Since perturbations to the refrac-
tive index of the plasma depend on pulse shape, different
laser shapes will vary in their coupling to the plasma. A
natural question therefore arises: what laser shape is the
“optimal” for laser-plasma accelerators?
The number of parameters involved in selecting a par-
ticular pulse shape can be overwhelming. One can char-
acterize a shape by the value of its total energy, length,
maximum laser field, amplitude of plasma wake, etc., in
addition to an infinite-dimensional space of actual shape
functions. Luckily, not all of these parameters are inde-
pendent or even well-defined. In this Letter we argue that
the only two meaningful parameters that describe a laser
shape from the stand point of wake excitation are the
total pulse energy and its depletion length. Using these
parameters different laser shapes can be consistently clas-
sified and cross-compared while desired properties such
as wake amplitude or efficiency can be optimized.
Let us consider a homogeneous unmagnetized plasma
which is charge neutral, at rest, and has initial density

gates along thezaxis with initial frequencyω

This expression can be understood in terms of the de-
position of laser energy into plasma. Due to negligible
scattering, the photon number in the laser is essentially
constant, and the laser energy loss is predominantly in
the form of frequency redshift, or photon deceleration

The energy density in the wake from (2) can then be
interpreted as the intensity-weighted integral of the pho-
ton deceleration throughout the pulse. Let’s denote the
wake-dependent part of the photon deceleration function
1

asκ(ζ)≡x
′
/x

. It is closely related to the character-
istic laser depletion lengthl
d
, or the distance in which
the maximally decelerated laser slice redshifts down to
ω

assuming a nonevolving wakefield.  From (3),l

, whereκ

is the maximum of
κ(ζ) inside the laser. The value of the peak wakefield in
(2) is bounded from above by the total laser energy and
the maximum photon deceleration:

One possible optimization problem can then be formu-
lated as follows: given some fixed laser energyε
0
(i.e.,
the integral ofa
2
), and the desired depletion length (i.e.,
κ
max
=κ
0
), what laser shape would produce the largest
possible wakefield? From (4) it is clear that such a shape
should maintain a constant maximal photon deceleration
throughout the pulse. If the laser is present forζ >0,
then in order to satisfy the boundary conditions the pho-
ton deceleration should rise from 0 to valueκ
0
at the
very beginning of the pulse, e.g., like a step-function:
κ(ζ) =κ
0
θ(ζ
+
). Here,ζ

≡ζ−0

in order to avoid
ambiguities with the values of step-function at 0. The
corresponding laser profile is then found from the wake

such that
∫

δ(y

)dy= 1.  A schematic drawing of
the optimal laser intensity variation and its associated
plasma wakefield are shown in Fig. 1.  Generally, the
shape consists of aδ-function at the front followed by a
ramp in intensity which is cut off atζ
f
.  In the linear
regime, whena

≪1,κ
0
→0, the ramp reduces to a tri-
angular shape found in [9,10]:a
2
= 2κ
0
(δ(ζ

) +ζ). We
note that (5) describes a family of shapes, rather than
a fixed shape.  The actual profile of the optimal pulse
depends on the deceleration parameterκ

set by the de-
sired depletion length and the pulse lengthζ
f
, which is
determined from the available total energy:

Although the pulse length cannot exceedζ
c
≡1/κ

, the
rise ofa

towards the end of the pulse guarantees that
any finite laser energy can be accommodated forζ
f

.
The two terms in (6) represent the energy contained in
theδ-function precursor and the main pulse. It is clear
that for a fixed total energy there exists a maximum value
ofκ
0
=ε
0
/2 which is achieved whenζ
f
→0, i.e., all
of the energy is concentrated in theδ-function.  This
shape, which is a particular case of the general optimal
shape (5), excites the largest possible wakefield and has
the smallest depletion length among all pulses of fixed
energy. For circularly polarized pulses with cylindrical
transverse crossection of radiusr

maximum achievable wake is then given by:

sity profile and its corresponding wakefield (arbitrary units).
The method used for obtaining the optimal shape (5)
is actually more general and can be used to determine
laser shapes that generate other variations in the nonlin-

, which for this case is the require-
ment of uniformity of photon deceleration, provides a
constraint onx(ζ), which can then be used to find the
laser shape from the wake equation. Alas, such a “re-
verse” solution is not always guaranteed to yield a physi-
cal (i.e., positive)a
2
(ζ), so, in general, caution is advised.
While the generation of large accelerating gradients is
a prerequisite for a successful accelerating scheme, the ef-
ficiency of acceleration should also be considered. For an
accelerating scheme that involves transfer of energy from
the driver beam to the accelerating beam, efficiency is
measured in terms of thetransformer  ratio, or the ra-
tio of the maximum rate of energy gain per particle of
accelerating beam to the maximum rate of energy loss
per particle of the driving beam.  In the case of laser-
plasma accelerators, where the driving and accelerating
beams consist of particles of different species, the follow-
ing kinematic definition is more useful:
R≡
|∂γ

/∂z|

|∂γ

,(8)
whereγ

andγ

are Lorentz factors for the driving and

electron bunch are accelerated via electrostatic interac-
tion with the wake, so|∂γ

It follows from this definition that the transformer ratio
is not only a measure of local accelerating efficiency, but
is also directly related to the maximum energy that can
be transferred to the accelerating beam particle over the
laser depletion length (assuming no evolution of the wake
during propagation).
As there is no absolute maximum ofR, we can only
look for a shape that maximizesRsubject to constraints.
For instance, among the pulses of fixed energy and deple-
tion lengthRis maximized by a pulse that produces the
largest wakefield. But this is precisely the optimal shape
found above. A more general proof involves considering
all pulses irrespective of total energy that create a given
value of wakefield. It can then be shown [11] that a pulse
which has the largest depletion length among these must
maintain a constant photon deceleration inside the pulse,
which again points to the shape (5). From (9) the opti-
mal transformer ratio is then:

whereL

is the pulse length.  In the linear
regime optimal transformer ratios for both LWFA and
PWFA schemes scale identically with the pulse/beam

[12]. The LWFA scheme is intrinsically
more efficient by a factor of 2ω/ω
p
, which is needed for vi-
ability of LWFA since lasers are typically “slower” drivers
than electron beams.
The advantage of using the optimal pulse shape is best
seen in comparison with the unshaped (Gaussian) pulse.
For a given Gaussian pulse (or any other non-optimal
shape) one can always construct a corresponding opti-
mally shaped pulse with the same laser energy such that
the photon deceleration across the optimal pulse equals
to the peak photon deceleration in the unshaped one (i.e.,
both pulses have equal depletion lengths).  Unshaped
pulses deplete first in the region where photon decelera-
tion is the largest, whereas a laser with the optimal shape
losesallits energy in a depletion length due to uniform
photon deceleration, thus enhancing instantaneous en-
ergy deposition and wakefield. For a numerical example,
we consider the optimal and Gaussian pulses of total en-
ergy 0.5J, wavelength 1μm and cylindrical radius 10μm
in a plasma withn
p
= 10
18
cm
−3
. The transformer ra-
tio, the maximum wakefield, the required pulse length,
and the corresponding peaka
0
are shown in Fig. 2 as
functions of depletion length.
From Fig. 2 we see that the transformer ratio and the
maximum wakefield are consistently larger for shaped
pulses.  In fact, the lines for optimal pulse wakefield
and transformer ratio represent theoretical upper lim-
its for all pulses of given energy.  The Gaussian pulse
achieves a maximum transformer ratio when its length
(measured here as FWHM) equals 1/2 of the relativis-
tic plasma wavelength. The effects of shaping are espe-
cially prominent for longer pulses, where Gaussian pulse
yields almost no wake excitation due to plasma oscilla-
tions inside the pulse that cause part of the laser photons
to absorb energy from the wake. On the other hand, a
shaped laser postpones plasma oscillation until the end of
the pulse, and all photons decelerate uniformly. For very
short pulses, the differences between the two shapes are
minimal. This is due to the fact that very short Gaus-
sian pulses of fixed energy asymptotically approach the
delta-function limit of the short optimal shape.

tential in shaped (diamonds) and Gaussian (triangles) pulses
of equal depletion lengths and constant pulse energy of 0.5J.
Although short pulses generally produce the largest
wakefields, their efficiency is close to minimal possible,
as the depletion length decreases faster than increase in
the wake. Therefore, the choice of the appropriate pulse
shape for LWFA stage will depend on specific experimen-
tal conditions. If the laser-plasma interaction distance is
limited by instabilities, diffraction or dephasing, then in
order to maximize the electron energy gain one should
try to achieve the largest accelerating gradient, which
can be accomplished with ultrashort pulses.  If, how-
3

ever, the interaction length is less constrained, such as
the case for propagation in plasma channels [13], then
using a finite-length shaped pulse will result in a greatly
improved overall energy gain per stage. An added ben-
efit of pulse shaping is the suppression of modulational
instability that affects unshaped pulses that are longer
than plasma wavelength. When all photons redshift, or
“slow down”, at the same rate, different laser slices do
not overrun each other, and the 1D laser self-modulation
is suppressed.

FIG. 3. Laser intensity (shaded) and the associated photon

As the optimal pulse shape is associated with a delta-
function precursor, the feasibility of such a structure may
be a concern. We note that the purpose of this precursor
is to bring the photon deceleration from zero in the qui-
escent plasma before the laser to a finite valueκ
0
at the
beginning of the main pulse. This can also be achieved
with a more physical prepulse, whose shape can be found
once a smooth functionκ(ζ) is chosen. For our example
we chooseκ(ζ) =κ

can be found from the available pulse energy. For a step-
function photon deceleration (α→ ∞) expression (11)
asymptotes to equation (5).  However, for finite values
ofαthe delta-function precursor spreads out and can
even disappear as shown in Fig. 3. The family of shapes
given by (11) is better suited for the finite-bandwidth
laser systems that have a lower limit on achievable fea-
ture size. The values of the maximum wakefield for pulses
in Fig. 3 are within few percent of the value for an equiv-
alent delta-function optimal pulse because the bulk of
the modified laser pulse still experiences constant maxi-
mal photon deceleration. The wakefield further degrades
with longer rise times ofκ(ζ). It is also possible to con-
struct optimal shapes that propagate in a pre-existing
plasma oscillation and act as wakefield amplifiers [11].
Such shapes also do not require delta-function precur-
sors.
Several issues should be addressed before the laser
pulse shaping concept can be fully utilized. Even without
the delta-function precursor, the finite laser bandwidth
will necessarily smooth out sharp rises and falls of the
optimal pulse shape. Although we do not anticipate ad-
verse effects when the feature size is much smaller than
the plasma wavelength, the 1D self-consistent laser evo-
lution and stability of realistic optimal shapes are cur-
rently under investigation. Another consideration is the
influence of the laser-plasma interaction in the trans-
verse dimension on the evolution of the pulse. Many of
the laser-plasma instabilities are seeded by the wakefield-
induced perturbations of the index of refraction. As we
have demonstrated in this Letter, the nonlinear index
of refraction can be effectively controlled through laser
shaping, thus suggesting the method of delaying the on-
set of these instabilities. Whether this approach increases
the growth rates of other instabilities, particularly in the
transverse dimension, remains to be investigated.
