Abstract
We develop a model of competition in the solar panel industry.  Solar firms manufacture pan-
els that are differentiated both vertically and horizontally, and compete by setting quantities.
The  equilibrium  of the  model is  consistent  with a set  of stylized  facts that we  document,
including  variation  in  prices,  markups  and  market  shares  across  firms.   We  calibrate  the
model using a new dataset data on prices, costs and shipments of leading solar companies,
as well as solar sales in four leading markets.  The calibrated model is applied to evaluate the
impact of a decline in the price of polysilicon, a key raw material used in the manufacture
of solar panels, on the equilibrium price of solar panels.

1. Introduction
The electricity generation sector is the leading contributor of greenhouse gas emissions.
Most plans to stabilize greenhouse gas emissions  view  solar photovoltaics  as an electricity
generation  technology  with  potential  to replace  a  sizeable  section  of fossil  fuel  generation

present however, electricity from solar photovoltaics constitutea very small fraction of the
world electricity production.  The cost of generating electricity from solar PV systems have
fallen over time.  A major factor behind this decline has been the continual decrease in the
price  of solar  panels  (also  called  solar  modules),  the  principal  component  in  PV  systems.
These  declines  have  brought  the  price  of  solar  generated  electricity  closer  to  the  price  of
electricity generated from conventional sources, but a gap still remains.
There has been an extensive examination in the literature of factors that have contributed
to  the  decline  in  solar  module  prices.   Most  of  the  existing  studies  are  based  on  learning
curves,  which  extrapolate  past  observations  about  the  relationship  between  the  price  of
solar modules and the volume of production (for example, see Swanson (2006) and Schaeffer
(2004)).   There  have  been  other  studies,  for  example  Nemet  (2006)  and  Bruton  (2002),
which  look  at  the  contribution  of  various  factors  like  plant  size  and  module  efficiency  in
reducing the price of solar modules.  Learning curve models and models like Nemet (2006)
are suited  to explain  how different  factors affect the cost of production.  The use of these
models  in  predicting  changes  in  price  depend  entirely  on  the  assumption  that  changes  in
cost will translate into identical changes in price.  If the solar moduleindustry was perfectly
competitive with modules being sold at a price equal to its marginal cost, then any reduction
in  cost would  result  in the  same  reduction  in  price.  The  solar module  industry,  however,
is not a perfectly  competitive  industry.  As documented  in section 2,there are differences
in  prices,  markups  and  market  shares  of  different  firms  in  the  industry,  all  indicative  of
deviation  from  the  assumption  of  perfect  competition.   Under  imperfect  competition,  the
effect on price of a change in cost would depend on how firms respondto the change in cost.
The use of price instead of cost in learning curve models and in Nemet (2006) provide a useful
simplification, but ignoring the role of competition among firms in determining equilibrium
prices is not without consequence.  For example, Nemet (2006) finds that changes in factors
that affect cost can only explain a part of the change in the price of solar modules in some
of the years considered in his study.  He argues that there was an increase in the extent of
2

competition in the industry  in those years,  which might partially account for the residual
variation in price over and above the variation in cost.  A contributionof this paper is to
develop a model that explicitly incorporates competition among firmsin the industry and
can be used to evaluate how changes in costs affect the selling price of solar modules.
In section 2 we lay down three empirical observations that capturethe salient features of
competition in the industry.  In section 3, we develop a model that is consistent with these
observations.  The model derives a demand function for solar modules, taking into account
the behavior of electric utility companies, power producers and solar module manufacturers.
Electric utility companies,  who deliver electricity  to consumers (either directly or through
local distribution companies), purchase electricity from solar power producers, who can be
individual  households,  businesses  or commercial  power  producing companies.   These  solar
power  producers  in  turn  demand  solar  modules  from  module  manufacturers.   The  solar
modules  made  by  different  firms  are  differentiated  both  vertically  andhorizontally.   The
module  firms  compete  by  setting  quantities  and  we  derive  a  set  of  equations  that  can  be
used to compute the equilibrium prices, markups and market sharesin this Cournot model.
The model can be extended to incorporate other features of thesolar industry, and sec-
tion 4 describes some of the possible extensions.  The inclusion of non-module (or balance-
of-system) costs does not affect the equilibrium strategies of themodule firms but increases
the price of solar generated electricity.  The effect of differences ininsolation(the intensity
of  incident  sunlight)  can  be  easily  incorporated  in  the  model.   Finally,  the  model  can  be
extended  to  consider  the  impact  of changes  in  usage  of different  factors  of  production  on
price of solar modules.  These  extensions  can be used  to investigatethe impact of decline
in balance-of-system costs, the impact of differences in insolation,and the impact of tech-
nological improvements like reduction in raw material requirements or plant automation on
the equilibrium price of solar modules and of electricity generated from solar modules.  The
data necessary to calibrate the basic model described in section 3 can obtained from publicly
available sources, as described in section 5.
3

In section 6, we put the calibrated model to use for one application.The price of polysili-
con, a key raw material used in the manufacture of solar modules, has declined in the last few
years and analysts expect further reductions in the price of polysilicon.  We use the model to
evaluate the impact of decline in polysilicon price on the price of solar modules.  Alternative
simulations are performed to evaluate the impact of decline in polysilicon price if competition
among firms intensify because of standardization of modules, or if solar generated electricity
becomes more differentiated from electricity generated from other sources.
We begin by giving a brief description of the solar module industry in thenext section.
2. The Solar Module Industry
The solar module industry consists of a number of firms located in many countries.  The
output of the firms is usually measured in watts of solar modules.
1
In 2011, the solar mod-
ule  industry  shipped  around 28,000 megawatts  of solar modules.
2
Contrary  to the casual
observation that solar modules are standardized homogenous products, solar modules sold
by different companies differ in many ways.  The most significant of these differences is in
theefficiencywith which they convert sunlight to electricity.  The more efficient thesolar
modules are, the smaller is the size of the module required to producea unit of electricity.
Small module size (or fewer modules) translate to lower expenses onthe accessories required
to mount the module on a rooftop or ground.  Thus higher efficiency  isvalued in a quan-
tifiable way, and we capture this by treating solar modules as being vertically differentiated
with regard to efficiency.  Even after adjusting for the efficiency ofthe modules, there is a
dispersion in the price charged per watt by different firms in the industry (see Figure 1).
In addition to efficiency, the modules sold by different companies differin other technical
1
Ideally, a solar module rated at 1 watt when exposed to sunlight for 1hour would generate 1 watt-hour
of electricity. In practice however, the amount of electricity generated depends on the intensity of sunlight,
the angle at which the modules are mounted, etc.

Efficiency Adjusted Selling Price for Solar Modules −

attributes as well in commercial attributes, like the offered warranty period.  Further, firms
also  differ  in  their  access  to  distribution  and  marketing  channels,  which  are  important  in
the sales of solar modules.  These  differences  in product characteristics,  together with the
dispersion in efficiency-adjusted prices seen in Figure 1, suggest that a differentiated goods
model with firms engaging in monopolistic competition would be appropriate for the industry.
However,  in  contrast  to  the  popular  Dixit  and  Stiglitz  (1977)  monopolistic  competition
5

model, there is also a dispersion in the markups charged by the firms inthe industry.  Figure
2 plots the markups (gross margins) of companies against their market shares.  As can be seen
from the figure, bigger firms tend to have bigger markups as would be implied by a Cournot
model,  although  there  are  deviations  from  a  simple  linear  relationship.The  observations
above can be summarized in three stylized facts,
1.  There is a dispersion in efficiency adjusted prices across firms.
2.  There is a dispersion in markups across firms.
3.  Larger firms tend to have bigger markups.
The next section develops a model of the solar module industry thatis consistent with
the three observations above.
3. The Model
Our model is a modification of the model developed in Smith and Venables (1988) and
Atkeson  and  Burstein  (2008).  We develop  the  model in  a number  of steps,  and begin  by
deriving the demand for solar modules in the next section.
3.1. Demand
The electricity industry consists of three vertically connected segments.  At the very top
are the electric utility companies who sell electricity to final consumers.  At the next rung are
the power producers (including solar power producers) who own power plants and generate
electricity  which  they  sell  to  the  electric  utility  companies.   At  the  bottom  rung  are  the
equipment  companies,  like solar module companies,  who manufacturethe equipment  used
by  power  producers  to  generate  electricity.   Demand  for  solar  electricity,  and  hence  solar
modules, is essentially driven by government policies, which differ across countries.  In many
European  countries  (Germany,  Italy,  Spain,  France  and  Czechoslovakia),  the  government
requires electric utility companies to buy electricity generated by solar power producers at a

Notes:Each point in the graph corresponds to a firm. The market shares were obtained by dividing the
annual revenue of the firm by an estimate of the total sales of solar modules. The estimate of total sales
was obtained by multiplying the average price of firms in the dataset by the total shipment of solar
modules in 2011.
guaranteed price.  In many U.S states on the other hand, the demand for solar modules stem
from Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) mandates, which requireelectric utility companies
to obtain a portion of the total electricity that they sell from renewable sources.  We abstract
from the differences  in policies and assume that for an electric utility  company,  the effect
of these policies is to make solar generated electricity an imperfect substitute for electricity

generated from other sources.

Electric utility companies choose the quantities of electricity
to procure from solar producers and other producers so as to minimize  their total cost of
production, i.e they solve the problem,

.  Hence,
if the price of solar electricity  relative  to the aggregate price index  for electricity  (

creases, the utility shifts away from conventional electricity and increases its procurement of
solar electricity.
The solar power producers, the second rung in the electricity industry, can be individual
households  who  have  solar  panels  on  top  of  their  houses,  or  companies  who  collect  solar
electricity from many households and sell to utilities (often calledaggregatorsin the indus-
try),  or solar power  plants.  We  model this  as  a competitive  segmentand firms  earn  zero
3
In addition to differences in regulatory policies, production variabilityis another important difference
between solar generation and generation from conventional sources. There is variability in the generation of
electricity from solar because of unpredictable changes in the environment, like the onset of clouds. Such
unforeseeable variability does not exist for generation through coal or natural gas.

profits in this segment.  Each solar power producer buys solar modules, which we model as a
differentiated good, and uses these modules to generate electricity.  As mentioned in section
2, firms are vertically differentiated by the conversion efficiency of the modules that they sell.
To accommodate this, we consider the the efficiency adjusted unitsof solar modules used by
a power producer.  In addition to this vertical differentiation with regard to efficiency, solar
modules are also horizontally differentiated.  We capture this using the production function
for the solar power producer,

whereq
j
is the quantity of modules from module producerj,e
j
is the efficiency of modules

We make the reasonable assumption thatρ > η >1, i.e the elasticity of substitution between
solar  electricity  and  electricity  generated  from  other  sources  is  less  than  the  elasticity  of
substitution  between  different types of modules.  Competitive  solarpower producers  solve

Hence the demand for solar modules for firm-jdepends both on how expensive the firm’s solar
module is relative to that sold by other firms,

, and how expensive solar electricity

Having  derived  the  demand  facing  each  module  producer,  we  move  onto  the  optimal
pricing decisions made by the module producers given the demand function above that they
face.
3.2. Equilibrium
We assume that the solar module firms engage in Cournot competition.  Each solar firm
takesP, the price index for electricity as given when making its quantity and price decisions.
But the firm considers the effect of its decisions on the solar module price index,P

, and
the price of solar electricity,P

.  We assume that module firms have a constant marginal cost
of production, and denote module firm-j’s marginal cost byc

It is possible that the marginal cost would decrease with increases inproduction (see Nemet (2006)),
but we ignore that for purposes of tractability.

The model is consistent with the observations about competition in the industry summa-
rized in Section 2.  Sinceρ >1, equation (9) implies that bigger firms (larger market share
s
j
) charge a lower efficiency-adjusted price (p/e).  Given this, and the assumption thatρ > η,
equation (7) implies that firms with higher efficiency-adjusted marginal cost (c/e) charge a
higher efficiency adjusted-price (p/e).
5
Thus firms charge different efficiency-adjusted prices,
consistent with Figure 1 and stylized fact 1.  Equation (8) implies thatfirms charge different
markups, consistent with stylized fact 2.  Sinceρ > η, equation (8) also implies that bigger
firms charging higher markups, consistent with Figure 2 and stylizedfact 3.

This is most easily seen by considering equation (7) for two firms, sayfirm 1 and firm 2. Equation (7)

11

Equation  (7) makes  clear  that price  can  vary from  cost.   The  factor by  which  price  is
greater  than  cost  depends  on  the  market  share  of  the  firm,  and  the  elasticitiesηandρ.
For bigger firms, the price/cost factor is larger.  Asηincreases, price/cost factor decreases
because  the  differentiation  between  solar  generated  electricity  and  electricity  from  other
sources decreases, and they become more direct competitors.  Asρincreases, the price/cost
factor decreases because the differentiation among the differentmodule firms decreases and
they become more direct competitors.
It  is  straightforward  to  compute  the  equilibrium  of  the  model,  if  the  unit  costs{c
j
},
efficiencies{e
j
}, and elasticitiesηandρare known.  Substituting equation (9) in equation
(8) gives a systemNnon-linear equations inNunknowns prices, and hence can be solved to
obtain the equilibrium prices{p
j
}.  The above model provides a tool to evaluate how module
prices change in response to changes in the cost of production of modules.  In many cases
one is interested not only in the price of modules, but also in the price of a fully installed
solar generation system, as well as in the price of the electricity generated from such systems.
In section 4 we outline how the above model can be extended to accommodate this.  With
additional data one can use the extension of the model to evaluatethe impact of cost changes
on the price of a fully installed solar system and on the price of solar generated electricity.
4. Extensions of the Model
The basic model of competition in the solar panel industry describedin section 3 can be
extended to incorporate other features of the industry.
4.1. Balance of System Costs and Insolation
The solar modules considered in the model above form the core of a solar photovoltaic
electricity  generation  system.   In  addition  to  the  cost  of  the  moduleitself,  the  cost  of  a
solar generation system also includes the cost of electrical components necessary to connect
the system with the electrical grid and the cost of mounting structures necessary to fix the
12

modules on a rooftop or on the ground.  There are also non-hardware “soft-costs” - the cost
of getting a permit to install the system, the cost of labor necessary to install the system,
etc.  As module costs are declining, the other costs, which are often collectively labeled the
balance-of-system costs, are becoming an important fraction ofthe total cost of the system
(see Feldman et al. (2012) and Aboudi (2012)).  The balance-of-system costs can be added
to the model in a simple manner, by assuming that cost of the total solar system is a factor
ktimes the module cost, i.e the total cost is nowk

i=1

.
Further, in addition to the characteristics of the solar module, theamount of electricity
that can be generated from a solar module also depends on the amount of sunlight that is
incident on the module.  This parameter is referred to in the industryasinsolation.  This can
be incorporated into the model by modifying the production function in equation (2) to,

s
=h

(10)
where the insolation factorhconverts the rated power into the actual amount of electricity
produced.
It  is  to  be  noted  that  the  balance-of-system  cost  factorkand  insolationhcan  vary
across markets.  The balance-of-system costs depend on the labor cost, permitting policies
in place and so on.  For example, Seel et al. (2012) report that the balance-of-system cost
in Germany was lower than in the U.S in 2010.  Similarly, the insolation factor would also
vary across markets, with sunny countries like Spain or India havinghigherhthan countries
like Denmark or Germany.  One could apply the above model to a specific region where the
insolation and balance-of-system cost factor remains the same across different solar power
producers, under the assumption that each module producer treats every region as a different
market.  Under this assumption, the problem of the solar power producer in market-ibecomes

The demand function for each module and the price index for modulesremain the same
as in the basic model (as given in equations (3) and (4) respectively).  The equilibrium prices
and markups also remain the same as before, as given in equations (7) and (8) respectively.
But  the  price  of  solar  generated  electricity  becomesP

.   Thus  the  price  of  solar
generated electricity will be lower in regions with lower balance of system costs and higher
insolation.   With  data  onk

andh
i
,  one  could  use  this  extension  of  the  basic  model  to
evaluate the impact of a decrease in balance-of-system costs on the price of solar generated
electricity.
4.2. Technological Improvements
Many technological improvements have contributed to the decline inmodule prices.  Im-
provements in efficiency has been an important contributor to the decline in module prices,
and  the  model  described  in  section  3  can  be  used  to  simulate  the  impact  of  increases  in
efficiency on module prices.  Another important facet of technological progress has been in
the reduction of the quantity of inputs needed to produce a watt of modules.  The quantity
of polysilicon needed to produce 1 watt of solar modules has decreased over the years (see
Swanson (2006) and Nemet (2006)).  Such technological improvements can be incorporated
into  the  model  by  considering  a  Leontief  production  function  for  the  production  of  solar
modules,

model  can  then  be  simulated  to  understand  the  impact  of  a  decrease  in  unit  polysilicon
requirement (a decrease ina), or the effect of a decrease in price of polysilicon (a decrease
inv).
In  section  6,  we  describe  how  we  can  calibrate  the  model  and  simulateit  to calculate
the impact of a decrease inv, the price of polysilicon.  In the next section we describe the
sources of the data that we use to estimate the model parameters necessary to calibrate the
model.
5. Data and Calibration
In the simulations to evaluate the impact of a decline in polysilicon price on module price,
we model the solar module industry as being comprised of 15 companies.  These include the
companies  which  were  in  the  top  10  in  terms  of  shipments  in  2011 (Suntech,  First  Solar,
Yingli, Trina, Canadian Solar, Sharp, Hanwha Solarone, Jinko, Solarworld and LDK Solar)
and 5 other leading module manufacturers (Sunpower,  REC, JA Solar,  Kyocera and Aleo
Solar).  Together these companies accounted for over 60% of theglobal shipments in solar
modules in 2011, and companies not in the list contributed less than 2 %each to the total
industry  shipments.   Among  the  15  companies,  14  companies  make  solar  modules  using
polysilicon as the raw material.  However the lowest cost firm, First Solar, uses a technology
15

different from the rest, and does not use polysilicon in its productionprocess.
6
We leave the
cost of First Solar at its 2011 level in our simulation.
The  variable  production  costs  of  12  of  the  above  companies  were  obtained  from  their
annual reports.  For each company, annual data was collected oncost of goods sold (COGS),
revenues and shipments.  For the U.S companies, the data was collected from their annual
10-K statements.  All the companies in the dataset that are basedin China are registered
in  U.S  stock  exchanges,  and  hence  file  an  annual  20-F statement  with  the  U.S  Securities
and Exchange Commission.  The format for the 20-F statement is similar to 10-K statement,
providing comparability between the data used for companies basedin U.S and China.  The
cost of goods sold (COGS) for the companies in the dataset filing 10-K and 20-F includes
the cost of materials, direct labor cost, utilities and depreciation ofcapital, and excludes the
expenses on R&D, marketing and general administration.  Hence the COGS reported by these
companies are a good measure of their variable cost of production.For the companies based
in Europe, the data was obtained from their annual reports.  While some of the European
companies report the cost of goods sold, some report only the earnings before interest and
taxes (EBIT). Subtracting the sum of EBIT and reported expenses on R&D, marketing and
general  administration  from  the  annual  revenues,  gives  a  measure  of  the  variable  cost  of
production that is comparable to the COGS reported by companies registered on U.S stock
exchanges.  All companies report their annual shipment of solar panels in watts.
The  use  of  cost  data  derived  from  annual  reports  of  companies  has  sometimes  been
criticized in the literature.  But there are a number of reasons to believe that concerns raised
are less severe for the cost data that is used in this study.  First, all the companies whose
cost data is used in the analysis are pure solar companies, so the variable costs they report
in annual statements are those associated with solar production alone.  Second, many of the
companies state in their annual reports that a substantial fraction of the COGS that they
6

16

report  are  material  costs,  which  are  usually  correctly  reflected  inannual  reports.   Third,
the unit cost of production is the most closely watched metric in the industry, and market
analysts routinely publish estimates of the units costs of companiesusing their own methods.
It is quite likely that the close scrutiny by industry observers puts aheavy burden on the
firms to report their costs truthfully.
The average variable cost of producing solar panels for each firm was obtained by dividing
COGS  by  annual  shipments.   For  the  3  companies  for  whom  cost  datawas  not  available
(Sharp, Kyocera, and Jinko), we used equation (8) to obtain the unit costs of the companies,
given their prices and market shares.  The prices for these companies were obtained from the
Photon Magazine or from their annual reports.  To provide an illustration of the accuracy of
the model in backing out costs from prices, we plot in Figure 3 the costs backed out by the
model against the actual costs of the companies for which we havecost data.
We  now  turn to  the  two  demand  parameters  whose  values  are  needed  to simulate  the
model, the elasticity of substitution between solar and non-solar electricity,η, and the elas-
ticity of substitution between solar modules,ρ.  A highηwould imply that solar electricity
is less differentiated from electricity generated from other sources.  We estimate the demand
elasticity from the data on module price and quantity sold in four markets - Germany, Italy,
Spain and France.  The data on annual solar installations in these countries is taken from
IEA (2010) and is available for Germany from 1990-2010 and for theother three countries
from 1995-2010.  The quantity sold in each of these markets is likely to be influenced by the
subsidy  policies  of the  governments,  which  we  include  in the  regression.  We  perform two
regressions to estimateη.  In the first regression, we do not use any instruments for price.
In  the  second  regression,  we  instrument  the  price  of  solar  moduleswith  the  total  market
share of firms from China in the worldwide shipments of solar modules.The entry of firms
from China prompted a decline in prices, either because of low cost ofproduction of firms in
China or because of production subsidies offered in China.  Hence theincreasing penetration
of Chinese firms in the solar market represent a supply side shock not correlated to demand

Next,  we  move  on to  the  value  ofρ.   A  highρwould  mean  that the  modules  are  less
differentiated products, and in factρ→∞would imply that the modules of different com-
panies are perfect substitutes.
8
As can be seen from equation (8), the value ofρdetermines
the markup (gross margin) of a small firm with almost zero market share.  From the annual
reports,  we note that the fixed operating costs in the industry  (including Selling,  General
and Administrative  Expense  and R&D expense)  is on average 10% of the revenues  of the
firms.  Since a firm that cannot cover its fixed cost will exit the industry, a value ofρ= 10
(which provides just enough profits to cover the fixed operating costs), seems appropriate.
The valueρ= 10 is also the one used by Atkeson and Burstein (2008).
8
In fact, for the case ofρ→∞, the model collapses to the standard homogeneous good Cournotmodel.

6. Impact of Polysilicon Price Decline
One of the factors that has contributed to the decline in module prices over the last few
decades is the decline in the price of polysilicon, the principal raw material used in building
crystalline silicon solar cells.  The average price of solar modules has declined by a factor of
close to over 50 in the period 1975-2010, and the cost of the polysilicon needed to make one
watt of solar modules has decreased by a factor of 20 over the same period (see Figure 4).
Following a sharp increase during 2004-2008, the price of polysilicon almost halved dur-
ing  2008-2010.   Yu  et  al.  (2012)  examine  the  reasons  for  the  changes  in  polysilicon  price
during 2004-2009 and conclude that demand shocks played an essential  role in the fluctu-
ations,  as  also  did  changes  in  cost  of  producing  polysilicon.
9
Generous  subsidy  schemes
for  solar  generated  electricity  implemented  in  many  European  countries  led  to  a  surge  in
the demand for polysilicon.  The rising polysilicon prices lead to an expansion in capacity
by  existing  polysilicon  firms  and  the  entry  of  many  new  firms  into  the  industry.
10
Total
worldwide polysilicon capacity increased from around 50,000 metric tons in 2005 to around
300,000 metric tons in 2010 (see Prior and Campbell (2012)).  Basedon investment  plans
announced  by  polysilicon  suppliers,  Winegarner  (2011) anticipates  polysilicon  capacity  to
increase  to over  500,000 metric  tons  in  2015.   These  increases  havebeen  accompanied  by
improvements  in the production technology,  as polysilicon firms found ways to reduce the
9
Yu et al. (2012) consider oil and natural gas shocks as the main source of changes in the production cost.
In addition to demand and production cost shocks, they also find that fluctuations in exchange rates had a
significant impact on polysilicon price. Note that the price of solar modules held steady despite the spike in
polysilicon price. This was possibly because of the increasing market penetration of lower cost firms from
China during the same period.
10
Hemlock, the leading polysilicon supplier increased its capacity from 7700 to 36,000 metric tons from
2005 to 2010. Wacker, the second largest established polysilicon supplier, increased its capacity from 5500
to 24,000 metrics tons. New firms GCL-Poly and OCI entered the market in 2007-2008 and quickly build
their capacities to 21,000 and 27,000 metric tons in 2010.

Figure 4: Decline in Solar Module Price and Cost of Polysilicon Used in SolarModules.
Notes:The prices of solar modules for 1975-2006 were taken from Maycock (2002) and from the dataset at
Earth Policy Institute. The price of solar modules during 2007-2010was taken as the quantity weighted
average of price of leading solar module companies. The data for polysilicon price and unit polysilicon
requirement was taken from Nemet (2006) for 1975-2002 and from Winegarner (2011) and company annual
reports for the years 2003-2010.
cost of production.  The addition of new capacity and intensifying competition among new
and established polysilicon manufacturers, as well as the development of new cost reducing
innovations in the manufacture of polysilicon, have led many industryobservers to forecast
a continued decline in the price of polysilicon and consequent decline in module prices (see
21

Fessler (2012) and Prior and Campbell (2012)).
We use a variation of the model described in section 4.2 to simulate theimpact of the
forecasted polysilicon price drop on the price of solar modules.  To focus on the impact of
polysilicon price declines, we consider a variation of the model with polysilicon as one input
and  all  other  inputs  lumped  together  as  the  second  input.   With  the  Leontief  production
function described in section 4.2, this results in the unit cost of firm-jbeing,

in 2011 was constructed from annual reports of leading polysilicon companies.  The annual
revenues  of four polysilicon  companies (Wacker,  REC, GCL-Poly andDaqo) were divided
by the annual shipments  to obtain the average  selling price of each company.  A quantity
weighted average of these prices was taken as the price of polysilicon, which was found to be
$59 per Kg.  The data onawas obtained for a few of the solar module companies mentioned
in section 5 from their annual reports, and the average value obtained was 5.6 grams per watt.

reduction in the price.  The simulations were  done for three value ofη,η= 5.5 which  we
consider as a baseline case based on the estimates in section 5, a low valueη= 2 and a high
valueη= 10.  Two values ofρwere also considered (ρ= 10, which is used in Atkeson and
Burstein (2008) and a value ofρ= 20).  Note that a higher value ofρmeans that products
are less differentiated, and firms have less market power.  The results are shown in Table 2,
with the last column showing the quantity weighted average module price.

a reduction  in module price  of between  8.6% and 16%,  depending  on thevalues  ofηand
ρ.   Note  that  the  module  price  is  lower  with  higher  values  ofηbecause  the  markups  of
the  module  companies  decrease  as  demand  for  solar  electricity  becomes  more  elastic  (i.e
solar generated electricity becomes less differentiated from electricity generated from other
sources.)   Similarly,  module price  is lower  with  higher  values  ofρbecause  the modules  of
different companies become less differentiated leading to a decreasein markups.  In all cases
listed in Table 2, the resulting module prices are still considerably higher than target values
given in many studies at which  large-scale adoption of solar would occur.  For example,  a
recent  study  by  the  U.S  Department  of Energy  (DOE  (2012)) setsa  target  module  price
of U.S $0.54 per watt to achieve large-scale residential adoption of solar in the U.S.

DOE (2012) estimates that a module price of $0.54 per watt is required to achieve a total system price of
$ 1.5 per watt, a price which DOE argues will make solar energy competitive with other generation sources
in the U.S. This target, and other similar ones, are based on many assumptions but provide a benchmark to
compare the results of the simulation.
23

result in equilibrium module prices near the targets given in DOE (2012).  To explore this,
we simulate the model with a reduction in non-polysilicon cost, alongside the reduction in
polysilicon price to $15 per Kg.  We assume that the non-polysilicon cost of all firms decline
by the same factor, and consider 3 scenarios in which the non-polysilicon cost declines by
25%, 50% and 75%.  Table 3 shows the results of the simulation.

If  we  take  the  module  price  set  by  DOE  (2012) of  $0.54  per  watt  as  a  target,  we  see
from  Table  3  that  a  75%  reduction  in  non-polysilicon  cost  achieves  thetarget  under  all
values ofηandρconsidered, while a 25% reduction in non-polysilicon cost will not suffice
under  any  of  the  values  ofηandρconsidered.   A  50%  reduction  in  non-polysilicon  cost
will achieve the target under the assumption of the high value forρ.  The simulations above
provide  a  first  attempt  at  using  a  rigorous  model  to  examine  the  impacts  on  equilibrium
price.  A useful extension  of the model would be to break up the non-polysilicon  cost,z
j
,
24

into various components like labor, capital and others and examine the effects of reduction
in these component costs on equilibrium module price.
7. Conclusion
We developed a model of competition in the solar module industry thatis consistent with
three observed facts.  Firms charge different prices,  they differ intheir price-cost markups
and larger firms tend to have higher markups.  The model was calibrated using data collected
from a number  of sources  and the calibrated  model was  used  to evaluate  the impact  of a
decline in polysilicon price on the equilibrium price of modules.  A 75% decrease in the price
of polysilicon leads to a 8.6% to 16% reduction in the average price of modules.  The decline
in polysilicon price by itself does not lead to module prices that are are considered necessary
in many studies to lead to large scale adoption of solar.  The polysilicon price reductions have
to be coupled with substantial reduction of over 50% in non-polysilicon costs to achieve such
targets.  Simple extensions of the basic model can incorporate other aspects of the industry,
like balance of system costs.  Such extended models can be used to evaluate the impact of
changes in the industry on the equilibrium price of electricity generated from solar panels,
in addition to the price of modules.
